# Code Smells and Refactoring
The art of identifying and refactoring poor code in software systems.

# General Information
* In each folder named with a number *(the software system id)* lies a software system in the `/code` directory.
* Each folder also has a `README.md` that contains the smells found and other details about that software system.
* Commit structure as a python string, `f"[{software system id}] info on smell/refactor"`.
